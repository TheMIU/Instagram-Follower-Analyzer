## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Warning

Instagram may limit how many users you can follow or unfollow per day.  
Exceeding safe limits (typically 100‚Äì200 actions/day) can result in temporary blocks, feature restrictions, or account bans.  
Use this tool responsibly and do not attempt to bulk-follow or mass-unfollow users.

## üöß Limitations

This tool does **not** use the Instagram API. While that helps keep things private and simple (no login or token required), it also comes with some limitations:

- **Manual Scrolling Required**  
  Instagram only loads a portion of your followers or following list at a time. You must manually scroll to the bottom of the list in the popup window to load all users before copying them. This can be time-consuming for accounts with many connections.

- **No Real-Time Sync**  
  The tool uses pasted data only. That means it won‚Äôt stay updated automatically. To get the latest results, you‚Äôll need to repeat the export and analysis process.

- **No Advanced Features (Yet)**  
  The tool is kept intentionally simple. Sorting, searching, or filtering capabilities are not built-in (for now).



### Why Not Use the Instagram API?

Using Instagram's official API comes with strict requirements:

- You need an approved Meta app
- Users must log in through OAuth
- Instagram severely limits access to follower/following data

Because of these restrictions, this tool avoids the API completely and keeps everything **private and local** - your data never leaves your browser.
